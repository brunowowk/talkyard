@* After OpenAuth or OpenID login authentication has been completed in this login (popup) window,
 * we here continue by showing a create user dialog. This is 1) for embedded comments pages â€”
 * then, login and user creation always happens in a login popup window (this window).
 * And 2) for logging in in the whole main window, to e.g. the admin area, or if the
 * site requires login.
 *
 * So don't call window.close() here. But in closePopupShowCreateUserDialog.scala.html we do the
 * same things, except that we also call window.close(), and continue in the opener instead.
