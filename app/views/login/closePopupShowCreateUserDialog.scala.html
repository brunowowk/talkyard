@* Closes the Identity Provider authentication popup window, and opens a
 * create user dialog in the window.opener instead (which should be the
 * main page where e.g. a forum topic and all replies are shown).
 *
 * Not for embedded comments logins, because then we'll continue running inside
 * the popup (see showCreateUserDialog.scala.html)  â€” would be tricky, UX wise,
 * to try to show a create-user dialog in Talkyard's iframe.

  Facebook mobile app problem?
</p>
<p>
  Did you go to here, via Facebook's mobile app?
  If so, you're likely using Facebook's built-in browser. It makes things break.
</p>
<p>
  Instead, copy the login URL, and log in outside Facebook.
  (Or outside any other mobile app you're using, if not Facebook?)
