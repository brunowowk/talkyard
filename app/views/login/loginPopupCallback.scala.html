@* If the text below appears, something is amiss â€” instead, we're supposed
 to be in a login popup win now, and we tried to close it, see above, and
 continue in the opener instead.

 But if that didn't work (then there's a bug), let's show a link to the homepage,
 so as not to leave anyone stranded.  (But don't bother translating, 0I18N.)
