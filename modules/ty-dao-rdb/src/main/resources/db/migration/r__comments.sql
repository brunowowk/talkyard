------------------------------------------------------------------------
comment on table  identity_providers_t  is $_$

OIDC and OAuth2 providers, e.g. a company's private Keycloak server.
$_$;


------------------------------------------------------------------------
comment on column  identity_providers_t.protocol_c  is $_$

Lowercase, because is lowercase in the url path. Is incl in the primary
key, so one can change from say  /-/authn/oauth2/some-alias to
/-/authn/oidc/some-alias without having to change the alias (or disable
the old authn for a short while).
$_$;


------------------------------------------------------------------------
comment on column  identity_providers_t.alias_c  is $_$

Alnum lowercase, because appears in urls.
$_$;


------------------------------------------------------------------------
comment on column  identity_providers_t.gui_order_c  is $_$

When logging in, providers with lower numbers are shown first.
(If one has configured more than one provider.)
$_$;


------------------------------------------------------------------------
comment on column  identity_providers_t.sync_mode_c  is $_$

What to do, when logging in, if there's already a user in the Ty database
with the same email address, or the same external identity id.
E.g. just login, don't sync. Or overwrte fields in the Ty database,
maybe even update the email address.'
$_$;


------------------------------------------------------------------------
comment on column  identity_providers_t.idp_access_token_auth_method_c  is $_$

How the Talkyard server authenticates with the ID provider, when asking for
the OAuth2 access token. Null and the default and 'client_secret_basic' means
HTTP Basic Auth, whilst 'client_secret_post' means 'client_id' and
'client_secret' in the form-data encoded POST body.
OIDC also mentions 'client_secret_jwt', 'private_key_jwt' and 'none',
see https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ClientAuthentication,
— Talkyard doesn't support these.

--  links_t
--======================================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------
comment on table  links_t  is $_$

There's no foreign key to link_previews_t, because maybe no preview has
been fetched yet (or maybe never — maybe broken external link).
$_$;



--======================================================================
--  link_previews_t
--======================================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------
comment on table  link_previews_t  is $_$

Caches html <title> and <meta description> tags and any OpenGraph tags,
and/or oEmbed json, for generating html previews of links to external
things, e.g. Twitter tweets.

Sometimes Ty fetches both 1) html and OpenGraph tags directly from
the linked page, and 2) oEmbed json.
Then, there'll be two rows in this table — one with fetched_from_url_c
= link_url_c, and one with fetched_from_url_c = the oEmbed request url.
The oEmbed data might not include a title, and then,
if the external link is inside a paragraph, so we want to show the
title of the extenal thing only, then it's good to have any html <title>
tag too.

[defense] [lnpv_t_pk] Both link_url_c and fetched_from_url_c are part of
the primary key — otherwise maybe an attacker could do something weird,
like the following:

    An attacker's website atkws could hijack a widget from a normal
    website victws, by posting an external link to Talkyard
    that looks like: https://atkws/widget, and then the html at
    https://atkws/widget pretends in a html tag that its oEmbed endpoint is
    VEP = https://victws/oembed?url=https://victws/widget
    and then later when someone tries to link to https://victws/widget,
    whose oEmbed endpoint is VEP for real,
    then, if looking up by fetched_from_url_c = VEP only,
    there'd already be a link_previews_t row for VEP,
    with link_url_c: https//atkws/widget — atkws not victws (!).
    (Because VEP initially got saved via the request to https://atkws/widget.)
    That is, link_url_c would point to the attacker's site.
    Then, maybe other code in Talkyard adds a "View at: $link_url_c"
    which would send a visitor to the attacker's website.

But by including both link_url_c and fetched_from_url_c in the primary key,
that cannot happen — when looking up https://victws/widget + VEP,
the attacker's entry wouldn't be found (because it's link_url_c is
https://atkws/..., the wrong website).

There's an index  linkpreviews_i_g_fetch_err_at  to maybe retry failed fetches
after a while.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
comment on column  link_previews_t.link_url_c  is $_$

An extenal link that we want to show a preview for. E.g. a link to a Wikipedia page
or Twitter tweet or YouTube video, or an external image or blog post, whatever.
$_$;


------------------------------------------------------------------------
comment on column  link_previews_t.fetched_from_url_c  is $_$

oEmbed json was fetched from this url. Later: can be empty '' if
not oEmbed, but instead html <title> or OpenGraph tags — then
fetched_from_url_c would be the same as link_url_c, need not save twice.
$_$;


------------------------------------------------------------------------
comment on column  link_previews_t.content_json_c  is $_$

Why up to 27 000 long? Well, this can be lots of data — an Instagram
oEmbed was 9 215 bytes, and included an inline <svg> image, and
'background-color: #F4F4F4' repeated at 8 places, and the Instagram post text
repeated twice. Better allow at least 2x more than that.
There's an appserver max length check too [oEmb_json_len].
$_$;


------------------------------------------------------------------------
comment on column  link_previews_t.status_code_c  is $_$

Is 0 if the request failed completely [ln_pv_netw_err], didn't get any response.
E.g. TCP RST or timeout. 0 means the same in a browser typically, e.g. request.abort().

However, currently (maybe always?) failed fetches are instead cached temporarily
only, in Redis, so cannot DoS attack the disk storage.  [ln_pv_fetch_errs]
$_$;


------------------------------------------------------------------------
comment on column  link_previews_t.content_json_c  is $_$

Null if the request failed, got no response json. E.g. an error status code,
or a request timeout or TCP RST?   [ln_pv_fetch_errs]
